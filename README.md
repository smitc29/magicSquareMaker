# magicSquareMaker
Generates a 'magic square' in a console window, where every row/column/diagonal has the same sum.

Utilizes C++, and was originally an undergraduate homework assignment. I cleaned up the code a little bit and re-generated the exe file so that it doesn't close immediately after generating the Square, making it much more practical. 
Probably won't add loop functionality to it, but might later on. 
Replaced initial use of arrays with vectors to handle memory better, and to allow greater data sets without issues. 

**2021-July-04**: Used guides to calculate squares, and haven't calculated every possible combo after dimensions of 9x9 due to number of calculations. Might add built-in checker at some point or something?
